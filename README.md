A simple python program for converting JPG files to PDF.

Instructions:
1. Pull from main branch.
2. Open command prompt window within the Jpg2pdf directory.
3. Enter the following command and press ENTER: pip install requirements.txt
4. Create a folder named pdf inside the Jpg2pdf folder (git doesn't like commiting empty folders, so this folder is not included in the repo and must be created by the user).
5. Place JPG files for converting into the jpg folder.
6. Run jpg2pdf.bat (this is just a windows batch file which simplifies running the python program, the command line arguments in the batch file may need to be changed depending apon how python is installed on your device).
7. The PDF files will be located inside the pdf directory that was created in step 4. Additionally the JPG files within the jpg directory are deleted at the end of execution.
